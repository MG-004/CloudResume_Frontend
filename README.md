# Cloudresume_frontend

This is the repo for my front end code for the Cloud Resume Challenge.

I used a no code editor to generate the HTML & CSS and then embedded Javascript code to invoke the API URL to update the visitor counter.

If you would like to find out more about this project feel free to visit www.choosingcloud.net where you will find a full blog post detailing my journey and the final project under the resume tab.

Thanks
